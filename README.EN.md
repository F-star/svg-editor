# svg-editor

A simple web svg editor. Built by Typescript. Developing...

Try the editor: https://blog.fstars.wang/app/svg-editor/

## Run project

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build Electron App

There is not electron dependency in `package.json`, because electron Installation is too big and someone maybe want not to build electron app. So you have to  install it manually:

```sh
npm install -g electron
```

If you are in China, maybe you should set npm config before install electron:

```
npm config set registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org/
npm config set ELECTRON_MIRROR http://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/electron/
```

build, then view or package:

```sh
# electron will use /dist/index as entry, so you have to build while you changed code.
npm run build

# view the result of electron
npm run electron
# or package electron app according to your OS
npm run electron:package
```
